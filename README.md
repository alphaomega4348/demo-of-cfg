<p id="description">This project involves developing a Flask server that processes audio files uploaded from a client-side React application. The server transcribes the audio using the Whisper machine learning model and compares the transcribed text to a target text using Google's Generative AI to determine their similarity, with results returned to the client and logged for analysis. Additionally, the project includes a Node.js server that manages metadata for teachers, students, and classes, and employs LLM models to generate test questions for teachers.</p>

<h2>🧐 Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

*   User-Friendly Interface: VisualFlow boasts an interface that is designed to be intuitive and easy to navigate. Users can efficiently interact with the platform even if they have limited technical experience thanks to its simplicity and clarity.
*   Drag-and-Drop Feature: With VisualFlow you can create flowcharts by simply dragging and dropping various elements onto the canvas. This feature eliminates the need for manual drawing and helps users quickly construct flowcharts visually.
*   C++ Code Generation: VisualFlow has the capability to automatically generate C++ code based on the flowchart you create. This feature streamlines the transition from visual design to functional code and is particularly beneficial for software development in C++.
*   Downloadable Flowchart: VisualFlow allows users to download their created flowcharts in a downloadable format. This feature enables you to save and share your flowcharts with others or use them in documentation or presentations.
*   Easy to Use: VisualFlow is known for its ease of use. It simplifies the process of flowchart creation and code generation making it accessible to a wide range of users without requiring extensive technical knowledge.
*   Built-In Compiler: VisualFlow includes a built-in compiler which means that you can compile the generated C++ code directly within the platform. This feature provides a convenient and integrated solution for testing and verifying the functionality of your code.

<h2>💻 Built with</h2>

Technologies used in the project:

*   React
*   React-Flow
*   Tailwind
*   MUI

<h2>Future Scope</h2>

- Incorporating machine learning and AI capabilities could help VisualFlow analyze flowcharts and suggest optimized code, making it more intelligent and adaptive to the user's needs.

- While VisualFlow currently supports C++, expanding its capabilities to cover a broader range of programming languages could significantly increase its utility. This would make it attractive to a more extensive community of developers and programmers.

- VisualFlow could be further developed for educational purposes. It could be used to teach programming concepts, algorithm design, and software engineering in an interactive and engaging way.
