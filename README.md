<p id="description">This project involves developing a Flask server that processes audio files uploaded from a client-side React application. The server transcribes the audio using the Whisper machine learning model and compares the transcribed text to a target text using Google's Generative AI to determine their similarity, with results returned to the client and logged for analysis. Additionally, the project includes a Node.js server that manages metadata for teachers, students, and classes, and employs LLM models to generate test questions for teachers.</p>
